# PS5-scraper

BeautifulSoup scraper running queries on the website of the (in)famous Italian store.
The script is compatible with Python 3.x versions.

## Configuration
Before starting the script, you need to install the following external modules through CLI (Windows/Linux/Mac: `pip3 install [modulename]`):
* `requests` (HTTP(S) requests)
* `bs4` (BeautifulSoup)

## Usage

The refresh rate is configurable with adjustable delay.

## Limitations

Notifications work only on Windows atm.

## Future Updates

I'm working to make this script running on a Telegram bot.
Cool idea, but I don't have that much time to implemetate it quickly.
